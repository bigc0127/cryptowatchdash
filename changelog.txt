Welcome to Version 16.5.1!

new in this version is notifications which can be turned on at any point.
this was a huge update and as such it does now how a new dependance which you will have to install before running CWD. 
also new in this version is the control center which lets you control some parts of CWD without needing to rerun the program.

IF YOU ARE COMMING FROM A VIRSION OLDER THAN 16.5 RUN THE UPDATER AGAIN

thats all.

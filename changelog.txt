Welcome to Version 15!

new in this version is i have added color coding to the break even.
this allows for easier glance understanding of what is at or above break even point.

Going Forward if Break-Even is green then it's at or above Break-Even (making money)
if Break even is Red then it is below Break-Even.

I have also changed the layout a little to better highlight gains and losses by currency

that's all Enjoy!

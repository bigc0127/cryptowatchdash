Welcome to Version 16.0!

new in this version is notifications which are turnd on at first run. this was a huge update and as such it does now how a new dependance which you will have to install before running CWD. 

please run the following command before using CWD " gem install ruby-notify-send " once that has been run you can enjoy all the notification goodness this version has to offer. in the future i will be expanding on the settings with a new settings page that you can configure. but for now this is a great start.

thats all.

Welcome to Version 15.1 !

New in this version is I have added color coding to the break even.
this allows for easier glance understanding of what is at or above or below break even point.

Going Forward if Break-Even is green then it's above Break-Even (making money)
if Break-Even is Yellow then it is at Break-Even (no loss or gain)
if Break-Even is Red then it is below Break-Even (loss money).

I have also changed the layout a little to better highlight gains and losses by currency

that's all Enjoy!
